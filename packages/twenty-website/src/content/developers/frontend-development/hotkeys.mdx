You can intercept any hotkey combination and execute a custom action.

There's a thin wrapper on top of [react-hotkeys-hook](https://react-hotkeys-hook.vercel.app/docs/intro) that makes it more performant and avoids unnecessary re-renders.

There's also a wrapper hook `useScopedHotkeys` that makes it easy to manage scopes. 

```ts
useScopedHotkeys(
  'ctrl+k,meta+k',
  () => {
    openCommandMenu();
  },
  AppHotkeyScope.CommandMenu,
  [openCommandMenu],
);
```
